# Pixel Flow Light

Pixel Flow is a node graph driven image processing application,
inspired by [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)'s node editor.

As opposed to the standard version of [Pixel Flow](https://github.com/madbrain/pixel-flow) which use backend computation with GEGL, this version is said to be _light_ as it is a pure frontend application and every computation is made in the browser.
